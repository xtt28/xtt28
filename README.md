# Hi, I'm [xtt28](https://github.com/xtt28) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with special interest in full-stack web application development and game modding. My projects utilize a variety of technologies that are consistent with the demands of the ever-changing software field.

## Notable projects

### [NFCActions](https://github.com/xtt28/nfcactions)

Control your computer with any NFC tag or card: one tap can launch any website, app or command.

### [Neptune](https://github.com/xtt28/neptune)

From the ground up, I implemented a classic Minecraft minigame with my own unique twist and published it to the world. The server lets players enjoy creatively designed competitive experiences augmented by reliable software and strong moderation systems.

### [CloudDrop](https://github.com/xtt28/clouddrop)

CloudDrop is a Django-based web app that lets users upload their files to private cloud storage. They can configure visibility for individual files and view a summary of their whole drive as a glance, contributing to a more intuitive expeirence.

### [Paste](https://github.com/xtt28/paste)

Written in PHP with MySQL, Paste is a web app that lets users share text files for quick reference. As a bonus, users can delete their own pastes without creating accounts, as well as set a time for their uploads to expire.

### [Micro](https://github.com/xtt28/micro)

I learned the inner workings of the HTTP protocol by leveraging Go's TCP library to build my own server that serves static files.
